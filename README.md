# Tic-Tac-Toe
Our group has developed a simple game of Blackjack using different features and modules of Python.

To play a hand of Blackjack the following steps must be followed:
•	Created a 2D array.
•	Display the arrays in form of a board.
•	Created X and O as the symbols for 2 players
•	Starting with X, asked player 1 for position of X. (1-9)
•	Similarly asked player 2 for O’s position. (1-9)
•	Process is repeated several times.
•	Check for winner is done after each chance.
•	Checks are done; Horizontally, Vertically and Diagonally.
•	Winner is shown when 3 of same type are in a line.
•	Game is stopped.
